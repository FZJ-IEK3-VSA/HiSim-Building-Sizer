To clone this repository, enter the following command to your terminal:

``python
git clone https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/HiSim.git
``

Set Virtual Environment
-----------------------
Before installing `hisim`, it is recommended to set up a python virtual environment. Let `hisimvenv` be the name of virtual environment to be created. For Windows users, setting the virtual environment in the path `\hisim` is done with the command line:

``python
python -m venv hisimvenv
``

After its creation, the virtual environment can be activated in the same directory:
``python
hisimvenv\Scripts\activate
``
For Linux/Mac users, the virtual environment is set up and activated as follows:

``python
virtual hisimvenv
source hisimvenv/bin/activate
``
Alternatively, Anaconda can be used to set up and activate the virtual environment:
``python
conda create -n hisimvenv python=3.8
conda activate hisimvenv
``
With the successful activation, `hisim` is ready to be locally installed.

Install package
------------------------
After setting up the virtual environment, install the package to your local libraries:

``python
python setup.py install
``
