# HiSim Building Sizer

The HiSim Building Sizer is a tool for optimizing the technical equipment of a building. The python package [HiSim](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/HiSim) is used to simulate and evaluate building systems for select configurations. Using an evolutionary algorithm, many possible building configurations are tested to identify the best combination of components.

All building parameters available in HiSim can be varied in the Building Sizer, e.g., photovoltaic system peak power, battery capacity, or consideration of electric vehicles.
Within the evolutionary algorithm, the distributed job manager [UTSP](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/UTSP_Client) is utilized to calculate all HiSim simulations of a single generation in parallel.


## About Us

We are the <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/iek/iek-3">Institute of Energy and Climate Research - Techno-economic Systems Analysis (IEK-3)</a> belonging to the <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/en">Forschungszentrum Jülich</a>. Our interdisciplinary department's research is focusing on energy-related process and systems analyses. Data searches and system simulations are used to determine energy and mass balances, as well as to evaluate performance, emissions and costs of energy systems. The results are used for performing comparative assessment studies between the various systems. Our current priorities include the development of energy strategies, in accordance with the German Federal Government’s greenhouse gas reduction targets, by designing new infrastructures for sustainable and secure energy supply chains and by conducting cost analysis studies for integrating new technologies into future energy market frameworks.
